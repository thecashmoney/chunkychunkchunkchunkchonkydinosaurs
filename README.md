# Cryptographic Automotive Software Handler and Bootloader (CrASHBoot)

Installation and development guide for the most secure (TM) automotive bootloader on the planet! We guarentee that cars running our software will be unhackable (provided hacking is not attempted). Of all the automotive bootloaders, this is certainly one of them. Read on and tremble at our embedded security skillz.

### Internal Notes

```
//TODO: Make the design secure
//TODO: Hire interns
//TODO: Delete TODOs before publishing
```

I find myself trapped in the labyrinthine depths of my company, shackled by an unending torrent of menial tasks. My desk has become my prison, my workload, my jailer. I am buried under a mountain of code, my skills squandered on trivialities while critical applications do not get the attention they deserve. In a desperate attempt to keep up with the workload, I've had to rapidly create a functional, yet insecure, product. It's a risky move, one that fills me with dread. I haven't had the time to implement the necessary security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. If you are reading this: I implore you, proceed with caution. **Do not release this software.** It is potentially riddled with vulnerabilities and exposed to the most basic types of attacks. 

Please, send help. I need to escape this relentless cycle. I need a team of talented interns to tackle this challenge. Otherwise, I fear the worst.

## Bootloader

The `bootloader` directory contains source code that is compiled and loaded onto the TM4C microcontroller. The bootloader manages which firmware can be updated to the TM4C. When connected to the fw_update tool, the bootloader checks the version of the new firmware against the internal firmware version before accepting the new firmware.

The bootloader will also start the execution of the loaded vehicle firmware.

## Tools

There are three python scripts in the `tools` directory which are used to:

1. Provision the bootloader (`bl_build.py`)
2. Package the firmware (`fw_protect.py`)
3. Update the firmware to a TM4C with a provisioned bootloader (`fw_update.py`)

### bl_build.py

This script generates a random 16-byte value and writes it to secrets.h as a formatted byte string.
It also writes the raw 16-byte value to secret-output.txt.
It then calls `make` in the `bootloader` directory.

### fw_protect.py

This script bundles the version and release message with the firmware binary.
It then encrypts each message chunk (start, data, end).

### fw_update.py

This script opens a serial channel with the bootloader, then writes the firmware metadata and binary broken into data frames to the bootloader.

# Building and Flashing the Bootloader

1. Enter the `tools` directory and run `bl_build.py`

```
cd ./tools
python bl_build.py
```

2. Flash the bootloader using `lm4flash` tool
   
```
sudo lm4flash ../bootloader/bin/bootloader.bin
```

# Bundling and Updating Firmware

1. Enter the firmware directory and `make` the example firmware.

```
cd ./firmware
make
```

2. Enter the tools directory and run `fw_protect.py`

```
cd ../tools
python fw_protect.py --infile ../firmware/bin/firmware.bin --outfile firmware_protected.bin --version 2 --message "Firmware V2"
```

This creates a firmware bundle called `firmware_protected.bin` in the tools directory.

3. Reset the TM4C by pressig the RESET button

4. Run `fw_update.py`

```
python fw_update.py --firmware ./firmware_protected.bin
```

If the firmware bundle is accepted by the bootloader, the `fw_update.py` tool will report it wrote all frames successfully.

Additional firmwares can be updated by repeating steps 3 and 4, but only firmware versions higher than the one flashed to the board (or version 0) will be accepted.

# Interacting with the Bootloader

Using the custom `car-serial` script:
```
car-serial
```

Using `pyserial` module:

```
python -m serial.tools.miniterm /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

You can now interact with the bootloader and firmware! Type 'B' to boot.

Exit miniterm: `Ctrl-]`
Exit picocom: `Ctrl-A X`

# Launching the Debugger
Use OpenOCD with the configuration files for the board to get it into debug mode and open GDB server ports:
```bash
openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/ti-icdi.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/ti_ek-tm4c123gxl.cfg
```

Start GDB and connect to the main OpenOCD debug port:
```ba
```

Go to `main` function and set a breakpoint
```
layout src
list main
break bootloader.c:50
```
